    "Kill teams grow in size in all manner of ways. High command might assign new soldiers. The kill team's boss might bully a lesser warrior into joining its mob. A new creature may daw and bite its way out of an amniotic sac, or a lone survivor might be found on the battlefield.",

Some have faced so many different threats they have gained new capabilities through alien manners of biological adaptation. Others have learned new skills along the way, only making them more likely to survive.',

Others have proven their worth and been mechanically upgraded by the masters they are programmed to serve. Many learn the skills to upgrade their own wargear, painstakingly combining rare components, or bashing them together until they resemble something that works.',
